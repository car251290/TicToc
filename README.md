# TicToc
A basic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML/JavaScript/CSS. No dependencies.

#How to get started
To make a move, the player will use the mouse single click to mark a space. In this version, there is no provision to undo the move. As soon as the move is done, the game proceeds to the next playerâ€™s chance.
At each move, The game will show whose move (Player A or Player B) it is. When the game ends, it displays one of the following three outcomes:
## Players
Winner: Player A

Winner: Player B
## The draw in Blue and Black
Draw is Blue and Black

## to start the code of the tictoc
var renderState = {
    minute: {style: 'blue', scale: 0.80, angle: 0},
    hour: {style: 'red', scale: 0.51, angle: 0}
  };

## for the drawhand and the function of the ctx 
var drawHand = function(handState, ctx, cx, cy, maxRadius) {
    ctx.lineWidth = 8;
    ctx.strokeStyle = handState.style;
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(cx, cy);
    ctx.lineTo(cx + Math.sin(handState.angle) * handState.scale * maxRadius,
               cy + Math.cos(handState.angle) * handState.scale * maxRadius);
    ctx.stroke();
  };

 ## the 'draw' event is being emitted after each call to rocky.requestDraw() but
## at most once for each screen update, even if .requestDraw() is called frequently
rocky.on('draw', function(drawEvent) {
    var ctx = drawEvent.context;
    var w = ctx.canvas.clientWidth;
    var h = ctx.canvas.clientHeight;
    
   // Draw a 12 o clock indicator
    drawHand({style: 'blue', scale: 0, angle: 0}, ctx, cx, 8, 0);
    drawHand({style: 'red', scale: 0, angle: 0}, ctx, cx, cy, 0);
  });
  
 ## listener is called on each full minute and once immediately after registration
  rocky.on('minutechange', function(e) {
    var wfh = new Rocky.WatchfaceHelper(e.date);
    renderState.minute.angle = wfh.minuteAngle;
    renderState.hour.angle = wfh.hourAngle;
    rocky.requestDraw();
  });
