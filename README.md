# TicToc
A basic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML/JavaScript/CSS. No dependencies.


#How to get started
To make a move, the player will use the mouse single click to mark a space. In this version, there is no provision to undo the move. As soon as the move is done, the game proceeds to the next playerâ€™s chance.
At each move, The game will show whose move (Player A or Player B) it is. When the game ends, it displays one of the following three outcomes:
Winner: Player A

Winner: Player B

Draw is Blue and Black

// to start the code of the tictoc
var renderState = {
    minute: {style: 'blue', scale: 0.80, angle: 0},
    hour: {style: 'red', scale: 0.51, angle: 0}
  };

// for the drawhand and the function of the ctx 
  
  var drawHand = function(handState, ctx, cx, cy, maxRadius) {
    ctx.lineWidth = 8;
    ctx.strokeStyle = handState.style;
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(cx, cy);
    ctx.lineTo(cx + Math.sin(handState.angle) * handState.scale * maxRadius,
               cy + Math.cos(handState.angle) * handState.scale * maxRadius);
    ctx.stroke();
  };

 // the 'draw' event is being emitted after each call to rocky.requestDraw() but
// at most once for each screen update, even if .requestDraw() is called frequently
rocky.on('draw', function(drawEvent) {
    var ctx = drawEvent.context;
    var w = ctx.canvas.clientWidth;
    var h = ctx.canvas.clientHeight;
  
    // clear canvas on each render
    ctx.fillStyle = 'black';
    ctx.fillRect(0, 0, w, h);
  
    // center point
    var cx = w / 2;
    var cy = h / 2;
    var maxRadius = Math.min(w, h - 2 * 10) / 2;
    drawHand(renderState.minute, ctx, cx, cy, maxRadius);
    drawHand(renderState.hour, ctx, cx, cy, maxRadius);
  
    // Draw a 12 o clock indicator
    drawHand({style: 'blue', scale: 0, angle: 0}, ctx, cx, 8, 0);
    // overdraw center so that no white part of the minute hand is visible
    drawHand({style: 'red', scale: 0, angle: 0}, ctx, cx, cy, 0);
  });
  
  // listener is called on each full minute and once immediately after registration
  rocky.on('minutechange', function(e) {
    // WatchfaceHelper will later be extracted as npm module
    var wfh = new Rocky.WatchfaceHelper(e.date);
    renderState.minute.angle = wfh.minuteAngle;
    renderState.hour.angle = wfh.hourAngle;
    rocky.requestDraw();
  });
